Quick one today. A lot of folks write for a while and then ask: why is nobody reading?  
My answer is simple: your content is fine, **your distribution is too narrow**. This post has one goal: grow your reach fast, without changing your stack or doing heavy ops.

## 1. Make sure people can find you

You do not need SEO mysticism. Just put human keywords into the title and headings:

- Put the words people would actually search in the title
- Use question-style subheadings
- Open each section with a one-line conclusion

**Example:**  
Do not write "I tinkered with something", write "3 gotchas when deploying a blog on Cloudflare Pages".

## 2. Write about problems you are solving right now

Readers are not pulled in by how good you are. They are pulled in by problems they also have.  
The bugs you hit, the tools you pick, and the workflow tradeoffs are natural entry points.

The easiest formula:  
**problem -> process -> conclusion -> repeatable steps**  
No fancy prose needed. Real and reusable wins.

## 3. Add a secondary share point

If people can only read the full article, sharing is slow. Plant one or two **quotable blocks**:

- A one-line takeaway
- A simple comparison image
- A short checklist

For this post, the shareable line is:  
**"If your blog is quiet, it is usually not the writing, it is the discoverability."**

## 4. Turn distribution into muscle memory

Publish, then post. Do not wait. Fix your channels:

- WeChat Moments / status / story
- Newsletter or Xiaohongshu (if you have one)
- Jike, Twitter, forums, V2EX

Do it 10 times and your traffic turns into a steady trickle instead of random spikes.

## 5. Create a new-reader landing post

You need a page that keeps new readers around.  
Something like: "What I write, what I care about, and the 5 posts I recommend."

Without that, they read one piece and leave.

## Final note

To grow fast, do not chase complex ops. **Fix visibility and shareability first.**  
Start with the next post: tweak the title, structure, and distribution. You will see results quickly.

That is it for today. Hope it helps.
