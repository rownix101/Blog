## 1. Our Policy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.

## 2. If We Discover Data

If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## 3. Parental Rights

Parents have the right to review, delete, and refuse further collection or use of their child's personal information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

## 4. Age Screening

We may implement age screening mechanisms to prevent users under the age of 13 from accessing certain features of our Service or providing personal data.

## 5. Compliance with COPPA

We comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.
